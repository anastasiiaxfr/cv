I have been working as Web/FE developer and advertise creator almost 7 years as part performance digital agency. My main stack Hugo + Headless CMS (Forestry.io, Netlify CMS etc) and Nuxt + Prismic.
Also I know WP, Sass, Gulp and CI tools. 

My first job was web-coding at PERFORMANCE DRIVEN DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY in-house like Saatchi & Saatchi. I mean a classic marketing campaign with an 80-90s approach, similar to Mad Man World.

I have totem pets, it's guinea pig. My hobbie is reading books.
I'm totally for the diversity approach. Free relationships, civil marriage and childfree. I'm for the absence of the Third Reich in Ukraine. I try to earn money abroad.

I also use Scrum, Kanban and have experience with a small internal team.

I don't work as a mixed part of the SEO department or affiliate, I usually work with the specialists of the 1: 1 team like UI, Devops and Backend dev.
